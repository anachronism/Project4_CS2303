CS 2303 Program 4 
Max Li, Alexi Kessler

This program stores item information in a binary tree. The nodes of the tree are Items, which contain 
Linked Lists of store structs, the structure used to record stores that have that item in stock. The output
is in the format of an item name followed by a store list, with each store being noted as a position and an 
item number. The stores are sorted by decreasing itemCount as specified in the assignment. An output for the 
test data is recorded in prog4.out.
